## Key Features Explained

### Hierarchical Scrollable View
The left panel displays your JSON in a tree structure that's fully scrollable, making it easy to navigate even the largest files. Each node shows:
- Objects with `{count}` notation
- Arrays with `[count]` notation
- Values with their actual content (truncated if long)

### Search Functionality
- **Text Search**: Type any text and click "Find" to search through keys and values
- **Regex Search**: Check the "Regex" checkbox to use regular expressions for advanced pattern matching
- **Enter to Search**: Press Enter in the search box to find the next match

### Right-Click Context Menu
Right-click on any node in the hierarchy to:
- **Save Node to File**: Export just that key and its contents to a separate JSON file
- **Copy Path**: Copy the full path to that node to your clipboard
- **Expand/Collapse Node**: Quick node management
- **Go to Node**: Jump to and focus on the selected node

### Double-Click Navigation
Double-click any node to:
- Focus and scroll to that position in the tree
- Automatically expand or collapse container nodes (objects/arrays)
